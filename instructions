Create the README file

In the prompt, type the following code:

$ mkdir ~/Hello-WorldCreates a directory for your project called "Hello-World" in your user directory
$ cd ~/Hello-WorldChanges the current working directory to your newly created directory
$ git initSets up the necessary Git files
Initialized empty Git repository in /Users/your_user_directory/Hello-World/.git/
$ touch READMECreates a file called “README” in your Hello-World directory
Open the new README file found in your Hello-World directory in a text editor and add the text “Hello World!” When you are finished, save and close the file.

Commit your README

Now that you have your README set up, it’s time to commit it. A commit is essentially a snapshot of all the files in your project at a particular point in time. In the prompt, type the following code:

More about commits

$ git add READMEStages your README file, adding it to the list of files to be committed
$ git commit -m 'first commit'Commits your files, adding the message "first commit"
The code above executes actions locally, meaning you still haven’t done anything on GitHub yet. To connect your local repository to your GitHub account, you will need to set a remote for your repo and push your commits to it:

More about remotes

$ git remote add origin git@github.com:username/Hello-World.gitSets the origin for the Hello-World repo
$ git push origin masterSends your commit to GitHub
Now if you look at your repository on GitHub, you will see your README has been added to it.
